## 🎯 Active Roadmap

### **Priority 1: Admin Dashboard** 🔧 ✅ PHASE 1, 2 & 2.5 COMPLETE

> **Goal:** Web interface to manage users, subscriptions, and content without touching code.

| Phase | Features | Effort | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 1 | User Management + Whitelist | 2-3 sessions | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 1.5 | User Detail + Ban/Actions | 1 session | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Analytics Dashboard | 1-2 sessions | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2.5 | Site Settings (Promo + Themes) | 1 session | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 | Knowledge Base Management (RAG Upload) | 2-3 sessions | 📋 Next |
| Phase 4 | Content Management | 2-3 sessions | ⏸️ Deferred |

#### **Phase 1 + 1.5: User Management** ✅

**Routes:**
```
/admin                → Dashboard overview (stats, quick actions)
/admin/users          → User list with search/filter
/admin/users/:id      → User detail page with all actions
```

**Completed Features:**
- [x] Admin role check (via `publicMetadata.role`)
- [x] Dashboard stats cards (total users, premium, free, whitelisted, active today)
- [x] Platform activity stats (conversations, messages, quizzes, games)
- [x] User list table with pagination and search
- [x] Mobile-responsive (cards on mobile, table on desktop)
- [x] Click user row to view details
- [x] **User Detail Page** with full profile, stats, actions
- [x] Grant/revoke premium access
- [x] Whitelist users (Friends & Family - permanent free premium)
- [x] **Ban/unban users**
- [x] View user usage stats (all-time + today)
- [x] Admin link in UserButton dropdown (only visible to admins)

**Backend Endpoints:**
```python
GET  /api/admin/stats           # Dashboard overview stats
GET  /api/admin/users           # List users (paginated, searchable)
GET  /api/admin/users/:id       # Get user details + today's usage
PATCH /api/admin/users/:id      # Update user (premium, whitelist, ban, role)
```

**Access Control:**
1. Set admin role in Clerk Dashboard: `{"role": "admin"}`
2. Frontend `AdminRoute` wrapper checks role
3. Backend `verify_admin()` function verifies admin on `/api/admin/*` routes

**To Set Yourself as Admin:**
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Your User
2. Edit **Public metadata** to:
   ```json
   {"role": "admin", "is_premium": true, "is_whitelisted": true}
   ```
3. Refresh your app - you'll see "Admin Dashboard" in the user menu

#### **Phase 2: Analytics Dashboard** ✅

**Route:** `/admin/analytics`

**Completed Features:**
- [x] Usage trends chart (7d/30d/90d) - chat, games, quizzes per day
- [x] User growth chart - new users per day
- [x] Feature popularity - pie charts for games + quizzes
- [x] Period selector (7 days, 30 days, 90 days)
- [x] Responsive design (stacked on mobile, grid on desktop)

**Not Implemented (future):**
- [ ] Revenue tracking (MRR, subscriptions) - needs Stripe integration
- [ ] Churn tracking - needs subscription history

#### **Phase 2.5: Site Settings (Promo + Themes)** ✅

**Route:** `/admin/settings`

**Completed Features:**
- [x] `site_settings` database table (key-value store)
- [x] Holiday Promo Management
  - [x] Enable/disable promo toggle
  - [x] Set promo end date
  - [x] Customize banner title
  - [x] Live banner preview
- [x] Theme Switching (Default, Christmas, New Year, Chamorro)
- [x] Theme-aware promo banners (different colors/emojis per theme)
- [x] Christmas snowfall effect (CSS animations)
- [x] Theme-aware logos across app (🌺 ↔ 🎄)
- [x] Settings caching (60s TTL for performance)

**Backend Endpoints:**
```python
GET  /api/admin/settings       # Get all site settings
PATCH /api/admin/settings      # Update settings (key-value pairs)
GET  /api/promo/status         # Public: Check promo + theme
```

**Database Table:** `site_settings`
```sql
key: 'promo_enabled'     → 'true' | 'false'
key: 'promo_end_date'    → '2026-01-06'
key: 'promo_title'       → 'Felis Påsgua! ...'
key: 'theme'             → 'default' | 'christmas' | 'newyear' | 'chamorro'
```

#### **Phase 3: Knowledge Base Management** 📚 (NEW PRIORITY)

> **Goal:** Allow admins to upload documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT) to expand the RAG knowledge base without touching code. Perfect for school partnerships (e.g., Hurao Chamorro school).

**Route:** `/admin/knowledge-base`

**Planned Features:**
- [ ] Drag & drop file upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- [ ] Background processing with status updates (30s-2min per file)
- [ ] Set source priority (educational, dictionary, archival)
- [ ] List indexed documents with stats
- [ ] View processing status/history
- [ ] Delete documents from RAG (optional)

**Backend Endpoints:**
```python
POST   /api/admin/knowledge-base/upload     # Upload + queue for processing
GET    /api/admin/knowledge-base/status/:id # Check processing status
GET    /api/admin/knowledge-base/documents  # List indexed documents
GET    /api/admin/knowledge-base/stats      # RAG stats (chunks, docs, etc.)
DELETE /api/admin/knowledge-base/:id        # Remove document (optional)
```

**Technical Notes:**
- Leverages existing `RAGDatabaseManager` class
- Docling for PDF processing (handles tables!)
- Token-aware chunking (~350 tokens/chunk)
- OpenAI embeddings for vector storage
- Background task queue for processing

**School Use Case:**
- Teachers upload curriculum PDFs → instantly searchable
- Import vocabulary lists and lesson handouts
- Preserve historical Chamorro documents

**Effort:** ~10-14 hours (including background processing)

---

#### **Phase 4: Content Management** (Deferred)

> **Note:** Deferred until there's a clear need. Current curated content is working well and can be edited via git.

**Would require full database migration:**
- [ ] Quiz question CRUD (add/edit/delete questions)
- [ ] Flashcard deck management
- [ ] Story management
- [ ] Game word lists

**Current state:** Content hardcoded in frontend TypeScript files. Works fine for now.

#### **Recently Completed (Dec 2025):**
- **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly, conversation created in background
- **Smooth Transitions**: Loading states when switching conversations
- **Auto-focus**: Input auto-focuses on desktop (not mobile to avoid keyboard)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on send (mobile devices)
- **Sidebar Auto-close**: Closes when selecting/creating conversations
- **Mobile Input Polish**: Smaller placeholder, compact buttons on mobile
- **Background Processing**: Refetch messages on window focus and page load to catch responses that completed while user was away
- **Edit & Regenerate**: Edit user messages with inline textarea, delete subsequent messages, regenerate AI response with full conversation context

#### **Parallel Streams** (Future)
- Allow multiple conversations to stream responses simultaneously
- Currently: switching conversations cancels in-progress stream
- Future: let streams continue in background, see completed response when returning
- Requires: per-conversation stream tracking, conditional UI updates

### **Priority 3: Learning Enhancements** 📚

| Feature | Effort | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Flashcard Spaced Repetition | 2-3 days | 📋 Planned |
| Onboarding Flow | 1-2 days | ✅ Done |
| User Preferences | 1 day | ✅ Done |
| Learning Streaks | 2-3 days | ✅ Done |
| Expand Story Content | 1-2 days | 📋 Planned |

#### **Onboarding Flow** ✅
- [x] Skill level selection (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- [x] Learning goal selection (Conversation, Culture, Family, Travel, Everything)
- [x] Modal appears on first sign-in
- [x] Preferences saved to Clerk `unsafeMetadata`
- [x] AI responses personalized based on skill level

#### **User Preferences Page** ✅ (`/settings`)
- [x] Update skill level and learning goal
- [x] Dark/light mode toggle (syncs across devices)
- [x] Theme preference saved to Clerk profile
- [x] Accessible from user dropdown menu

#### **Admin Preference Management** ✅
- [x] View user's skill level, learning goal, onboarding status
- [x] Edit user preferences directly
- [x] Reset onboarding (user sees modal again on next login)
- [x] New endpoints: `POST /api/admin/users/:id/reset-onboarding`, `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/preferences`

#### **Learning Goal Personalization** (Future)
Users select a learning goal during onboarding (conversation, culture, family, travel, or "everything"). Currently this is stored in Clerk's `unsafeMetadata` but **intentionally NOT applied to chat prompts**. 

**Why not use it in chat?** After testing, we found that filtering all responses through a learning goal lens (e.g., always mentioning travel vocabulary) made responses feel forced and could reduce quality when users ask about unrelated topics. The chat should respond naturally to what users actually ask.

**Better uses for learning goals (future):**
- [ ] Personalized homepage recommendations ("Based on your travel goal...")
- [ ] Daily word filtering (show travel vocabulary for travel goal)
- [ ] Suggest relevant flashcard categories
- [ ] Prioritize stories that match the user's goal
- [ ] Adjust conversation practice scenario recommendations
- [ ] Show goal-specific tips and resources

**Note:** The `LEARNING_GOAL_MODIFIERS` dict is defined in `chatbot_service.py` for future reference but is not currently applied.

#### **Flashcard Spaced Repetition (Phase 2)**
- Database tracking for card progress
- Confidence ratings (Hard/Good/Easy)
- "Due for review" scheduling
- Progress indicators

#### **Learning Streaks** ✅
- [x] Daily streak counter (`/api/streaks/me` endpoint)
- [x] Streak widget on HomePage and Dashboard
- [x] Personal best tracking
- [x] Today's activity breakdown (chat, games, quizzes)
- [x] Guam timezone for day boundaries
- [ ] XP system for activities (future)
- [ ] Achievements/badges (future)
- [ ] Activity calendar (future)

#### **Expand Story Content**
- Add more Lengguahi-ta stories
- Blog content extraction
- Target: 50+ stories
